# Kendo UI: jQuery and Angular Suites Integration

Please read the companion help topic [Integration with Kendo UI for jQuery](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/framework/kendo-jquery/).

[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) provides the build system for this application.

## Development Server

1. Run `ng serve` for a dev server.    
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.    

The application reloads automatically if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component.

You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Builds

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Tests

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests through [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-End Tests

Before running the tests, make sure that you are serving the application through `ng serve`.

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests through [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
